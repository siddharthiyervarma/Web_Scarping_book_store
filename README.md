## Project Description: Bookstore Analytics
Introduction:
The "Bookstore Analytics" project involves the analysis of a dataset containing information about books available in an online bookstore. The dataset includes details such as the book title, price, ratings, and URL.

## Objectives:
1. Data Cleaning:

Remove unnecessary characters from the "Price" column.

Ensure consistent data types for accurate analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Explore the distribution of book prices.
Analyze the distribution of ratings.
Investigate relationships between prices and ratings.

3. Top Books:

Identify the top-rated books.

## Workflow:
1. Data Cleaning and Processing:

-Importing necessary libraries for data manipulation and analysis.

-Loading and exploring the credit dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.

-Identifying and handling missing values, restructuring features, and ensuring data integrity.

-Converting categorical variables into numerical format through techniques such as one-hot encoding.

2.  Model Building:

-Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets to facilitate model evaluation.

-Building an initial decision tree model to predict credit approval.

-Visualizing the decision tree to interpret the decision-making process.

-Implementing pruning techniques to optimize model performance and avoid overfitting.

-Identifying and evaluating the importance of features for better model interpretation.

-Exploring ensemble methods such as bagging, boosting, and random forests for improved prediction accuracy.

3. Evaluation and Interpretation:

-Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

-Generating confusion matrices to gain insights into the true positive and false positive predictions.

-Analyzing the interpretability of decision tree-based models in the context of credit approval.
